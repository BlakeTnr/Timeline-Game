Nat Turnerâ€™s rebellion was a slave revolt by a slave named Nat Turner. Nat Turner revolted and killed white plantation owners and their families. Southers reacted by executing the 55 slaves that participated and killed over 200 in the days after. This increased tension by creating stricter rules for slaves and making white people more afraid of slaves, thus more aggresive.
