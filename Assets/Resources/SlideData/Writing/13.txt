The Fugitive Slave Acts were acts that were put on slaves that allowed for the seizure and return of runaway slaves who escaped from one state into another. This applied to northern states as well. It also imposed penalties on anyone who aided a black person, including white people. This increased tension as now people were allowed to take runaway slaves from the north and bring them back to the south.
