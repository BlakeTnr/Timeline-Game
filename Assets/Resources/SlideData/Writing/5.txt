The American Colonization Society was a group of people who said we should send slaves back to Africa. This was actually going to be done for a bit, but eventually was not. This led to conflict because this was a middle ground solution which abolitionists weren’t very happy with as most of the slaves were born in America, so sending them “back” to a place where they have never been made little sense.
