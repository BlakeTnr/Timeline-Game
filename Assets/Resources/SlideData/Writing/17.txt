John Brown's Massacre was a situation where a radical abolitionist and a group of other murdererd five proslavery men in response to the sacking of Lawrence by pro-slavery forces. This led to the civil war because violence is breaking out and blood is being shed. There was a loop where southerners attacked northerners and now retaliation is happening.
