The cotton gin, created by Eli Whitney, was used in the south as it allowed for the easy separation of cotton and its seeds. This increased the need for slavery to use these machines and to pick the cotton. Slavery before this was actually decreasing in the southern states! So obviously it making slavery take a 180 increased to the tension as this was the reason slavery was used.
